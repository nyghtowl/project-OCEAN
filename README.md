This repository contains code and related content for the OCEAN open source project.

## Overview / Goal
Project OCEAN is an open science collaboration focused on understanding the open source ecosystems & creating the datasets that enables research purposes and helps in forming a clear understanding of the state of open source communities. OCEANâ€™s goal is to understand the health of the open source communities. 

### Open Source Community Ecosystem Focus
We are focused on studying the following ecosystems :
- Angular
- Go
- Node
- Python

## Project Datasets 
We are collecting a list of datasets that would be useful for this project which are based on our ecosystem focus. The link below provides the latest list which is an ongoing work in progress. 

**[OCEAN Open Source Ecosystem Data Map](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vROZwJ7Bzzp58XHnS1LlfeJ5aLhKCugp9IzgaX5jCtZ9vki42Xrfy55HxJKAsrrDx1zZss4EsvbiQMX/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)**

If you know a dataset that should be on the list or have some updates to recommend, for now submit an Issue with as much of the following information that you have:

- Dataset Name 
- Brief Description
- EcoSystem
- Data Category (governance model, source code, issue tracker, project docs, release infra, package repo, package manager, social board, community org)
- Raw Data Location (where is it stored)
- Size (GB/TB/?) - (if you record a different size, note it next to the number)
- Accessible (How can we access it either API or scrape with permission or no access option or something else)
- Start Date (When it started being collected - at a minimum what year)
- End Date (When it stopped being collected or note today if its kept current - at a minimum what year)
- Update Frequency (How often it is updated - daily, monthly, etc)
- Reference Links (especially dataset schema and other info that is useful)
- License Information (if there is any licensing or terms and conditions attached to the data source)
- Other Info


## OCEAN External Faculty Program

If you want to particpate in prioritizing the datasets we capture for research and collaborate with researchers on this effort there will be a process to apply to join the group. More details will be posted when we have them. For insights into the group checkout [OCEAN Vermont Exernal Faculty Program](https://github.com/Vermont-OCEAN).

## Contributing
We welcome outside contributions to the project especially considering when we are studying open source communities. Junior and senior contributors are all welcome. We have a list of Issues that provide ideas on where to start. Feel free to send in PRs , if you have something to change or to add.
